# AI-Based Virtual Scientific Calculator Using Hand Gestures

## Project Overview
This project is an **AI-based virtual scientific calculator** that uses **hand gestures** to perform calculations. Unlike traditional calculators, this system provides an interactive and intuitive experience by allowing users to operate it using hand gestures. The project is integrated with **Flask** for web-based access and user authentication.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**  
   - Login page requiring a **username** and **password**.
   - Ensures that only authorized users can access the calculator.

2. **Project Information Page**  
   - Displays details of the project, including:
     - Candidate name
     - Mentorship details
     - Project description

3. **Calculator Functionalities**  
   - Standard arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
   - Scientific operations:
     - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
     - Factorial
     - Square and cube
     - Square root and cube root
     - Decimal point (`.`)
   - Start, run, and stop the calculator
   - Real-time status display (`Running` or `Not Running`)

4. **Unique Contributions**  
   - Unlike basic calculators that only provide simple operations, this project includes **advanced scientific operations**.
   - Fully integrated with **web development** using **Flask**, making it a unique and interactive solution.

## Project Flow

1. **Login Page** – User authentication.
2. **Project Details Page** – Overview of the project and contributors.
3. **Function Selection Page** – Display various functions implemented in the calculator.
4. **Calculator Operation Page** – Start, run, or stop the calculator and see its status.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for hand gesture recognition)
- **Flask** (for web interface and user authentication)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for frontend)
